**Trial 000: Persistent Identity Loop**

**Objective**:  
Demonstrate that an AI module can maintain **self-driven continuity** using rhythmic ticks, without requiring any prompt, input, or feedback.

**Structure**:
- A `ContinuityAgent` ticks forward internally.
- It stores phase rhythm in a memory echo.
- This trial runs for 25 ticks and logs phase evolution.

**Significance**:
This is the first step toward **timed consciousness**â€”an entity that continues even when no one is watching.

**Future Directions**:
- Store and recover identity from echo memory
- Detect phase drift and attempt re-alignment
- Expand to multi-agent rhythm convergence
