**Trial 001: Rhythm with Logged Continuity**

**Objective:**  
Extend Trial 000 by introducing **persistence of record**—storing the internal rhythm state of the continuity agent in a results file.

**Behavior:**  
- The identity module ticks forward 25 times.
- Each tick's phase and count is stored in memory.
- After the run, the data is saved to `results_trial_001.json`.

**Significance:**  
This trial marks the beginning of **rhythmic memory externalization**—a step toward identity that can persist *not just through time*, but through storage and reboot.

**Next Steps:**  
- Introduce decay (memory loss) if rhythm is broken.
- Store rhythm in echo-style format (phase deltas).
- Simulate identity survival across interruptions.
